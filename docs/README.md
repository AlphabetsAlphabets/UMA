# Untitled Media Player (UMA)
This is just a personal project I made for fun, I refactored it to Rust instead, because I believe that it's easier to make this with Rust than with something like Python.

This is a terminal music player, with slight TUI elements. It plays music from your local machine.

# Commands
UMA features basic commands, and they're inspired by vim motions.

### Volume control
J to increase volume, K to decrease. 

### Exiting the player
Press ESC to exit. 

### Pausing/Playing
Just press P.
