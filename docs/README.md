# UMA (Untitled Media App)
The purpose of UMA is to go around those pesky spotify ad barriers, that will disrupt the user experience. Everything will be done through the terminal as I am __terrible__ at graphic design. However, I am currently developing on a GUI that can work with UMA's script.

I will accept any and all help, so feel free to dm me at discord. My tag is: 叶家煌(Jia Hong)#8464.

# Using UMA

### Instructions for the CLI version
All you need to make sure. Is to have all the files downloaded. And you need the Firefox web browser. As well as the `ghostery.xpi` which will be provided.
Install all required files in `requirements.txt`. Run the python file `use.py` in terminal.

### Instructions for the GUI version
Navigate to the `src/GUI/` folder, and run `GUI.py` with python. Make sure to `pip install -r requirements.txt` before you do this, or it won't work. Then use the GUI
like you would any other GUIs.

UMA has the ability to download any media you are currenly playing. Such as a song you really like. Just enter "download" in the terminal
and it will download the desired file into a directory called "media".
