# UMA (Untitled Media App)
The purpose of UMA is to go around those pesky spotify ad barriers, that will disrupt the user experience. Everything will be done through the terminal as I am __terrible__ at graphic design.

I will accept any and all help, so feel free to dm me at discord. My tag is: 叶家煌(Jia Hong)#8464.

# Using UMA
UMA has a mnemonic based player system. Where FF5 would translate to Fast Forward 5 seconds, FF10 is Fast Forward 10 seconds and so on.
The mnemonic system, is **currently just an idea**, P is for both Pause and Play depending on the situation.

# Why use UMA?
UMA has the ability to download any media you are currenly playing. Such as a song you really like. Just enter "download" in the terminal
and it will download the desired file into a directory called "media".
