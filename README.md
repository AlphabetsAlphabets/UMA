# UMA (Untitled Media App)
The purpose of UMA is to go around those pesky spotify ad barriers, that will disrupt the user experience. Everything will be done through the terminal as I am __terrible__ at graphic design.

I will accept any and all help, so feel free to dm me at discord. My tag is: 叶家煌(Jia Hong)#8464.

Documentation located [here](https://github.com/YJH16120/UMA/blob/main/docs.md)

# Using UMA
All you need to make sure. Is to have all the files downloaded. And you need the Firefox web browser. As well as the `ghostery.xpi` which will be provided.
Install all required files in `requirements.txt`. Run the python file `use.py` in terminal.


# Why use UMA?
UMA has the ability to download any media you are currenly playing. Such as a song you really like. Just enter "download" in the terminal
and it will download the desired file into a directory called "media".

### Known limitations
1. Unable to display the following content available. Similar to YouTube, where there is a column with all other videos you can possible choose from.

2. Unable to skip to a specific portion of the video. (This hasn't been an issue for me yet, so feel free to create an issue when needed)

3. Unable to skip straight to next video, once it has ended (When that auto-play button shows up)

4. Unable to skip straight to next video, on command.
